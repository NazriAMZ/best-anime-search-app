# PROMPTS THAT I USED

1.  Create a useDebounced hook in typescript - a simple debounce hook that I can code myself but saves time using AI
2.  Use shadcn popover to display search results - I needed a boilerplate for the popover on showing the search results below the search bar
3.  create a type for the jikan api - I gave the sample response to gemini, and it created the types for me
4.  Apply any best practice in this page and show how to improve it - I showed my original code for the DetailPage and it showed me where I can improve it
